# Correlation and Linear Regression

## Measures of Center

There are three methods to measure the center of a quantitative data set:

1. Mean — sum of data values divided by number of data values
2. Median — the middle value after sorting of data
3. Mode — the highest point in the histogram

The median is a more robust measure than the mean; that is, it is not highly affected by the presence of outliers.
